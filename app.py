**How Terrain-Aware Distance is Calculated:**
This application now uses the Google Maps Elevation API to fetch the altitude for each point in your linestring.
The "terrain-aware" (3D) distance between two consecutive points is then calculated using a simplified
Pythagorean theorem: $D_{3D} = \sqrt{D_{2D}^2 + (alt_2 - alt_1)^2}$, where $D_{2D}$ is the 2D geodesic distance
between the points on the Earth's surface, and $(alt_2 - alt_1)$ is the difference in their elevations.
